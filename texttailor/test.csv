,"Inspired by the casual surroundings of the American farmhouse, Kincaid's Weatherford collection blends timeless simple style with exceptional craftsmanship. Weatherford is a Kincaid original and is made from solid New Zealand Pine. It takes a number of design and construction techniques from the early wood workers. One example is the uneven board lay-up that shows off the individual pieces of solid wood that make up each part of the furniture. This highlights the solid wood furniture construction and becomes part of the two Weatherford finishes. The two finishes are: Cornsilk - a lighter, almost white color reminiscent of a time-worn painted fence. Heather - a gray-brown blend inspired by weathered barns Weatherford combines the best of modern furniture features with the authentic benefits of solid wood in an heirloom-quality construction. Notable features include the Kincaid Soft-Close drawer system.
