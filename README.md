This is a sample project for cursor workshop

Idea is to use Cursor IDE to figure out 

# Entry points
[shop_parser_spider.py](texttailor/texttailor/spiders/shop_parser_spider.py)

# What to try
- Try to make sense of the repo using "Chat with Codebase" feature
- add tests using Composer
- add logging
- suggest refactoring plan
- try to launch the app / scripts
  - implement missing functions (imports) using the name
  - generate requirements.txt

# Bonus

Pick a feature from the list and try to implement it

- Ask Claude to suggest improvements, pick one and implement
- export common functions to a separate module
- create a sample launch script
